proj_raspi
==========

3D function surfaces using homogeneous coordinates for the Raspberry Pi

First "make" the linear algebra routines in tools/optmath.

Then go to proj and "make". See the first pictures by typing "./proj".

You may have to install the following packets and some more to compile this:
x11proto-core-dev
x11proto-input-dev
x11proto-kb-dev
x11proto-render-dev
x11proto-xext-dev

The 3D models live in proj/data.

The programs to calculate the 3D models live in proj/calc.

All the programs have hardcoded file names and code that can be commented out and back in.

Bad style!

When I did this back in 1994 I did not even think about publishing this on the internet...
